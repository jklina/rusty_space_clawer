## Rust Space Hauler Client

This is a simple example of a Rust client for the [Space Hauler](https://lq-space.herokuapp.com) online game. Once logged in, all the commands listed in the documentation should be able to be used. See:

[https://lq-space.herokuapp.com](https://lq-space.herokuapp.com)

for details.

All commands are literally strings, no need to parse them as JSON before sending them. For example:

`plot_course [[10,10,1]]`

is what you'd type to set a course.

### Development

PRs welcome! This is my first Rust app so I'm sure there's lots of ways to improve things!
